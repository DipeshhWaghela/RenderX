# RenderX
Image to Image generation

app.py : Serves the application purpose. Can be executed locally  
deploy.py : Was used for prototype purpose for deploying on cloud platform in render and 
streamlit, some issues were faced. I think render platform premium version can solve 
over issue of deployment, it failed on the free one but there are more better approaches.  
Local setup: 
1. Run the app.py script in VScode with python installed. 
2. Get a Hugging face api_key from the platform and make a services.toml, and add the 
key to it. 
2. In the terminal mention streamlit run app.py, to run it as a local. 
3.  
It has returned that the local system is configured with GPU, as we get True. 
4.  
Transform image â€“ used for generation of image.
